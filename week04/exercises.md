# Exercise 4.1 - Content

Prepare a static web page (using HTML) to represent the set of exam scores of the previous weeks.

The page must visualize a list of exams, with their scores. For now, the exams will be statically written into the HTML source.

Try to use "semantic" elements to delimit different parts of the page.

# Exercise 4.2 - Styling

Define a suitable layout and style, using CSS and the Bootstrap framework, to the previous HTML page.

Add a sidebar, that may contain (future) navigation options.

# Exercise 4.3 - Controls

Add a set of forms/buttons, that may allow editing (modify/delete) the current exams, and insert new ones.
